Welcome to the Github Repository for the Dojo, Group M4's capstone project for Northeastern University's electrical and computer engineering capstone class.

The Dojo project represents the next leap forward 2D fighter game training. Our project hopes to use AI to help you learn Street Fighter combos as fast as possible by breaking down a video of a combo into the moves that you will have to perform, storing those moves into an object, and then deploying that object into our arcade controller which will then light up the buttons you need to press in the order that they need to be pressed and will give you feedback for each move that you attempt to perform. While we are limiting ourselves to basic combos for the moment so that we can demo a working prototype come December, the eventual goal would be to program our model to detect any possible move and then store them for later practice accordingly.

If you have any questions or suggestions for our project, please feel free to reach out to lamptey.f@northeastern.edu or lawande.v@northeastern.edu - We'll be happy to help. Also, as we begin to assemble our physical prototype, we'll upload pictures and other information to this repo as needed
